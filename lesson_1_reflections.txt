The git is useful for version control
It is used in a big projects where alot of people are working on the same code set
Using diff tool we can see the difference in the files automatically
 



%%%%Lesson 1 reflection 2

Git commits are checkpoints in the project
Commits should be done on regular basis if there are logical changes in the project
Commits should be done even if there are typos have been fixed
or changes in the function features


%%%%Why commit should reflect changes on each and every file in the repository

The collection of the files which makes the project is whole called repository 
The project is often dependent on the multiple files. If for example if we added some features we need to make modification to each and every file in the repository. Now if we make git diff on the commit id's we can see the difference in each commit on each file with respect to the previous commit


Git clone is used to fetch the remote repository to the local machine
Git log - gives the log of all commits history
Git diff - shows what has been changed from the last commit
every commit has its id... first four digits can be used to access that commit.

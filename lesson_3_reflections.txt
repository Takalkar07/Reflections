When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When there are many people working on the same project remotely. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- When we do the git pull origin --branchname it pulls the all commit from that branch present remotely to your
local repository. It changes the current state of your local to updated one.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

-Forks When we have to clone the repository on the Git hub We use the Fork on Github. It points to the initial owner of that repository. We  can pull forked repository, pull make changes and push again.
-Clones - we can copy the contain of the remote repository by cloning it to the local repository.

-Branches - Branches can used locally to try out different features for the project.   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

--- When we know the last state of the remote locally (origin/master), we add commits on top of that, we can make git diff to see what changes have been made since the last sync of the local with remote master.	

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
